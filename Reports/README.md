# Scripts for processing Control Center reports

This folder includes scripts for processing the "JPO reports" that are created by Control Center. While it is already possible to parse and analyze such reports using the generic scripts in the folder above (csv-filter.py and sgt.py), these scripts are focussing on specific purposes and reports.
